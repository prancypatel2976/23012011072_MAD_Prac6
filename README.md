<b>AIM:</b> Create Android Application to demonstrate Frame by frame animation and splash screen to demonstrate twin animation.<br>
<b>Describing:  </b>In this project, an Android app is developed to showcase two types of animations.<br>
The Splash Screen appears first, using tween animation (such as scaling, rotating, translating, and fading) to smoothly display the app logo before moving to the main screen.<br>
The Main Activity demonstrates frame-by-frame animation using an ImageView and AnimationDrawable, where multiple drawable images are displayed one after another to create a motion effect.<br>
